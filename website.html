    About Me
  </h1>
</div>
    <div class="intro">
        <p> My name is Nick Faulkner and I am currently a sophmore at Brown University. I was born and raised in a small tourist town
          called Homer, Alaska. (The picture of above was taken in Homer of its famous Katchemak Bay) For highschool, I decided to attend
          Phillips Academy Andover in Andover, Massachussets. After four, amazing years at Andover, I then chose to attend Brown
          University.

          During my freshman fall at Brown, I decided to take an introductory computer science class, as it was something I had never
          done before but was very interested in. As it turns out, I absolutely loved in and decided to major in it. My passion for
          computer science comes in the form of using to create programs that allow people to take advantage of our greatets resource: eachother.
          I admire modern day companies that use technology to bring people together for mututal benefit. Developing and
          making these sorts of technologies easy to use and accesible to everyone is a goal I have for myself moving forward.

  <p> As the final project to my introductory computer science class, I had to choose from a variety of games to make from scrath,
    and I chose Pacman. Built in Java, using object-oriented programming, I created Pacman completely on my own, without any stencil
    code. For the ghosts searching functionality, I created an algorithm that uses breadth first search of the board to continuously
    update the ghost's target location.
